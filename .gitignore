#A .gitignore file is used in Git version control systems to specify files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by Git.
#When you add rules to the .gitignore file, Git will not include those files when you run commands like git add . to stage changes for commit.
#This helps to keep your repository clean and avoids cluttering it with unnecessary or sensitive files.
#For example, we can add the following types of files to a .gitignore file:
#Compiled Files: *.class, *.jar, etc.
#Temporary Files: *~, *.swp, etc.
#Log Files: *.log
#Dependency Directories: node_modules/
#IDE and Editor Files: .idea/, .vscode/, etc.
#Environment-specific Files: .env
#Sensitive Information: secrets.json
#Generated Files: dist/, build/
#Operating System Files: Thumbs.db
